#! /bin/awk
# Simple AWK shell script to read parameters from study1.csv for a 
# simulation study and sending each line to the Parms.csv file that is 
# read by the Stella model and then simulates the model using 
# Stella Simulator. After simulating the model, the Results.csv file, which 
# is the output from the Stella model, are processed by the R script
# process_run.R and appended to the study results file. 
# 
# Run this with from the command line with: 
#   awk -f simulate_study.awk -v MODEL="limits to growth.stmx" study1.csv
